<p class="info">
The hate u give is a book about police brutality, racism, courage and how one person can make a change. This story talkas about racial bias and how often black people are often assumed to be up to no good and how hard it is to not be judged. It follows the story of teenage Starr whos child hood best friend was shot while she was in the car.  He was pulled over then shot when the police officer shot him for leaning in to ask Starr if she was ok. It talks about how people can band together and demand justice for the wrong doing of others and fight against a brocken system. I think that it is a good book and is beautifully written with a good message and it adresses topics that are important in todays developing society.

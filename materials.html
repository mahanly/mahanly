His dark materials is a trilogy consisting of the books, The northern lights, the subtle knife and the amber spy glass. 
It is about a alternate universe where a lot of things are different. One of things is that in this universe your soul 
is outside your body this is your dæmon. dæmons can take any form they want while you are a child but when you get older 
it settals on its final appearance. it could be as a wolf or a butterfly, it dosent matter. It follows the young lyra as 
she embarks on a adventure that would not only lead her to the people that hav been stealing kids from her town but also
talking polerbares, gypses and much more. In the story lyra plays a important part in the future of her universe as she is
special and is one of the few who can read the special alethiometer. in the storys she meets will a boy from our universe 
who accidentally gets sucked into theirs. He holds the special subtle knife which cuts the very fabric of time and lets him
travle through universes.

The first book was made into a movie in 2007 but its story varys a lot from the book. It gets quite bad reviews at around 42%.
